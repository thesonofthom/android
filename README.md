MyBoardGames is my first attempt at an Android app.
It is a powerful tool to allow users to organize and track their board games and search a massive database of other board games to add to their collection.

It provides the following features:

 - Keep track of the board games you own by syncing with your BoardGameGeek.com account
 - Keep track of board games that you have lent to a friend
	 - Integrates seamlessly with your device's Contact list
 - View detailed information about a board game provided by BoardGameGeek.com, including:
	 - Box art
	 - Basic information
		 - Year published
		 - Minimum and maximum number of players
		 - Average playing time
		 - Minimum age
	 - Detailed description
	 - List of expansions, if applicable
	 - Categories
	 - Mechanics
	 - Publishers
	 - Designers
	 - Artists
	 - Honors and awards
 - Sort your list of games by
	 - Name
	 - Minimum number of players
	 - Maximum number of players
	 - Playing time
	 - Year published
 - Search for new games to add to your collection, backed by BoardGameGeek's massive database
 - Filter your list of games to find the perfect game to play right now! Available filters:
	 - Number of players - only show games that can support the specified number of players
	 - Playing time - only show games that can be completed within the specified range of time
